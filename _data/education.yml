    The MEES program allowed me to obtain a broad understanding of the many aspects of engine system design, from strengths/materials/joints,  fluid and thermodynamics, combustion/emissions, and simulation.  It highlights the many aspects of 
    Our MEES team decided to pursue a motorsports-focused, turbocharged, spark-ignited gasoline engine design, which allowed a study into turbocharging and displacement-downsizing of a previously naturally-aspirated engine platform.  The project highlighted the many design and performance trade-offs, and gave us a feel for how an engine-based project could play out.
